# Sub2API Floating Monitor

A small Windows desktop floating monitor for Sub2API and local Codex/Claude usage logs.

It can run in two useful ways:

- `auto`: read Sub2API admin metrics when available, then fall back to local client logs.
- `local-codex`: read local Codex/Claude JSONL logs only. This mode does not need Sub2API or any API key.

## Features

- Always-on-top resizable desktop floating window.
- Current active Sub2API accounts and concurrency.
- Today's request count, token count, and estimated cost.
- Account ranking with token, cost, request count, and simple health badges.
- Local Codex/Claude token import for conversations that did not pass through Sub2API.
- Codex fork replay de-duplication to avoid inflated token totals after branching a session.
- UTC+8 footer clock.

## Requirements

- Windows
- Python 3.10+
- Tkinter, included in the standard Python installer on Windows

No Python packages are required.

## Quick Start

Local-only mode:

```powershell
.\start-local-codex.ps1
```

Auto mode:

```powershell
.\start-monitor.ps1
```

Or run directly:

```powershell
python .\monitor.py
```

## Sub2API Mode

Copy `.env.example` to `.env`, then fill in your local admin settings:

```env
SUB2API_MONITOR_MODE=auto
SUB2API_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8080
SUB2API_ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@sub2api.local
SUB2API_ADMIN_PASSWORD=your-password
```

Use strict Sub2API mode if you do not want fallback:

```env
SUB2API_MONITOR_MODE=sub2api
```

## Local Codex Mode

Local mode scans:

- `%USERPROFILE%\.codex\sessions`
- `%USERPROFILE%\.claude\projects`

It writes a generated `client_usage_today.json` next to the scripts. This file is ignored by Git.

Useful settings:

```env
SUB2API_MONITOR_MODE=local-codex
CLIENT_USAGE_CODEX_DEFAULT_MODEL=gpt-5.5
CLIENT_USAGE_MAX_SINGLE_EVENT_TOKENS=2000000
```

`CLIENT_USAGE_MAX_SINGLE_EVENT_TOKENS` is a guardrail for abnormal single events.

## Forked Codex Sessions

Codex can replay previous context into a forked session. If a usage importer treats those replayed totals as new work, daily token counts can jump dramatically.

This version detects `session_meta.payload.forked_from_id`, skips the initial replay window, de-duplicates repeated total counters, and prefers `last_token_usage` when present.

## Files

- `monitor.py`: floating window and Sub2API/local data source.
- `client_usage_export.py`: local Codex/Claude JSONL usage scanner.
- `start-monitor.ps1`: normal auto-mode launcher.
- `start-local-codex.ps1`: local-only launcher.
- `run-monitor.cmd`: CMD launcher.
- `run-client-usage-export.cmd`: export local usage JSON once.

## Privacy

Local mode reads only local usage logs and does not send them anywhere. Sub2API mode talks only to the `SUB2API_BASE_URL` you configure.
